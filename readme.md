# TypeScript and Object-Oriented Programming

Programming language TypeScript<br>
App digital and physical products

### After completing this app:

### How does TypeScript enforce type safety in this object-oriented program?
I create a safe environment, in order to know exactly the input, return types of the functions or variables.<br>
I have more lines to write, but it is ok to know what you expect from one function.

### How did inheritance reduce code duplication for PhysicalProduct and DigitalProduct?
Parent & Child relation between files.<br>
Inheritance makes the reuse of a function and not repeat the same function or code many times.

### What are the benefits of using encapsulation and access modifiers (public, private, protected) in this context?
It gives a secure layer of protection against outside malicious code. It protects the data and gives access from only one source. Improve safety

### If you had to add a new type of product (e.g., a SubscriptionProduct), how would polymorphism make this extension straightforward?
Reuse of the methods with the same name but different values, it will apply method overload and override.
